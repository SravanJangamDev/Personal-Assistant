************** Personal Assistant(PA-one place to look at) ********************

Base idea for this application:
	1. Need a place to note down the tasks that we are going to do.
	2. Need to know which are all completed and pending.
	3. Need a place to add important remainders
		- marriage dates, birthdays, payment dates, ...
	4. Need to add important information(for record purpose)
		- payment made information
		- Any thing that we need to maintain a copy
	5. Need a place to note down all the expences that we made.
	6. Document storage
		- aadhaar, pan,... certificates
		- reciepts
		...
	7. Image storage(Private images and documents will be password protected.).
	8. Need a place for family to get the required information in case of our abscence.
